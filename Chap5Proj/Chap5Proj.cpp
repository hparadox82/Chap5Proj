// Chap5Proj.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
/*Write a program that will predict the size of a population of organisms. 
The program should ask the user for the starting number of organisms, 
their average daily population increase (as a percentage), 
and the number of days they will multiply. 
A loop should display the size of the population for each day.
Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 2 for the starting size of the population. 
Do not accept a negative number for average daily population increase. 
Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of days they will multiply.
